            <h2>Newyork City</h2>
	    <p>The Empire State Building is one of New York's most famous landmark buildings <br>
	     and key tourist attractions. The 381-meter-tall, 102-storey building was the <br>
      	     tallest in the world until the 1 World Trade Center tower rose higher, 41 years later.<br> 
             Topped with a mooring mast for airships,the Empire State Building immediately <br>	
 	     became a landmark and a symbol for NYC when it opened in 1931.</p>

	   <h2>Tokyo</h2>
	   <p>Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, <br>
             from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine <br>
             is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits <br>
             amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from <br>
             classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater <br>
             (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum)</p>
